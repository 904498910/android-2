## Getting started

We're currently evaluating a variety of CI systems and suggested development environments. Android provides a rich set of environments, most of which are currently supported. You can familiarize yourself with the code by working on the following low hanging fruit:
- bug fixes
- layout fixes
- security fixes
- improving the test suite
