## Contributing

Thanks for helping us make DuckDuckGo for Android! DuckDuckHack has been a
great success and so we've taken the steps necessary to open sourcing our apps.

* If **you are a developer**, you're in the right place! 
* If **you are not a developer**, there is still a lot you can do at our [ideas site](http://ideas.duckduckhack.com/) like suggest and comment on prospective features and ideas.

 Both of these roles are very valuable and will help direct community efforts.

To get started with development, check out the CONTRIBUTING guidelines.

## Suggestions and bugs
If there isn't already an open issue that describes your bug or feature, please submit one.

  * If you're submitting a bug, please describe a way we can reproduce the issue(s).
  * Be sure to add the version you're experiencing the issue on.
  * If you're submitting a feature (cool!), make sure you contact us before you do any work to ensure that you aren't duplicating efforts and that your changes are aligned with the goal of the app.

Some of the best features of DuckDuckGo came from the community; so stay in touch!
